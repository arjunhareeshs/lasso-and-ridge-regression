"# lasso-and-ridge-regression"
Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features (like size, location, number of rooms, etc.) using Ridge Regression, a regularized linear regression technique. Ridge Regression helps reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the linear regression cost function.

Features

Predict house prices based on multiple input features

Handles multicollinearity in data

Regularization to prevent overfitting

Train-test split for model evaluation

Dataset

The dataset should contain features such as:

Feature	Description
Size	Size of the house in square feet
Bedrooms	Number of bedrooms
Bathrooms	Number of bathrooms
Location	Categorical variable for location
Year_Built	Year the house was built
Price	Target variable (House price)

You can use any CSV dataset containing house prices and relevant features.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd house-price-prediction


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Evaluation

The model can be evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RÂ² Score

Dependencies

Python 3.x

pandas

scikit-learn

numpy

joblib (optional, for saving models)
